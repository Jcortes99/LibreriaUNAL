A few first copies were printed and illuminated by William Blake himself in 1789; five years later he bound these poems with a set of new poems in a volume titledSongs of Innocence and of Experience Shewing the Two Contrary States of the Human Soul.The work compiles two contrasting but directly related books of poetry by William Blake.Songs of Innocencehonors and praises the natural world, the natural innocence of children and their close relationship to God.Songs of Experiencecontains much darker, disillusioned poems, which deal with serious, often political themes.
