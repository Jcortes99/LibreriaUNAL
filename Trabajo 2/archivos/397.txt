The Art of Travel
Any Baedeker will tell uswherewe ought to travel, but only Alain de Botton will tell ushowandwhy.With the same intelligence and insouciant charm he brought toHow Proust Can Save Your Life,de Botton considers the pleasures of anticipation; the allure of the exotic, and the value of noticing everything from a seascape in Barbados to the takeoffs at Heathrow.Even as de Botton takes the reader along on his own peregrinations, he also cites such distinguished fellow-travelers as Baudelaire, Wordsworth, Van Gogh, the biologist Alexander von Humboldt, and the 18th-century eccentric Xavier de Maistre, who catalogued the wonders of his bedroom.The Art of Travelis a wise and utterly original book. Don’t leave home without it.
