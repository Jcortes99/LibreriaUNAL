Half Baked Harvest Cookbook: Recipes from My Barn in the Mountains
Tieghan Gerard grew up in the Colorado mountains as one of seven children. When her dad took too long to get dinner on the table every night, she started doing the cooking--at age 14. Ever-determined to reign in the chaos of her big family, Tieghan found her place in the kitchen. She had a knack for creating unique dishes, which led her to launch her blog,Half Baked Harvest. Since then, millions of people have fallen in love with her fresh take on comfort food, stunning photography, and charming life in the mountains.While it might be a trek to get to Tieghan's barn-turned-test kitchen, her creativity shines here: dress up that cheese board with a real honey comb; decorate a standard salad with spicy, crispy sweet potato fries; serve stir fry over forbidden black rice; give French Onion Soup an Irish kick with Guinness and soda bread; bake a secret ingredient into your apple pie (hint: it's molasses). And a striking photograph accompanies every recipe, makingHalf Baked Harvest Cookbooka feast your eyes, too.Whether you need to get dinner on the table for your family tonight or are planning your next get-together with friends,Half Baked Harvest Cookbookhas your new favorite recipe.
