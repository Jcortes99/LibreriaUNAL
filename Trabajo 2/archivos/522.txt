A Light in the Attic
Last night while I lay thinking hereSome Whatifs crawled inside my earAnd pranced and partied all night longAnd sang their same old Whatif song:Whatif I flunk that test?Whatif green hair grows on my chest?Whatif nobody likes me?Whatif a bolt of lightning strikes me?...This 20th anniversary of Shel Silverstein'sA Light in the Atticincludes a CD of highlights from his Grammy Award-winning album.Here in the attic of Shel Silverstein you will find Backward Bill, Sour Face Ann, the Meehoo with an Exactlywatt, and the Polar Bear in the Frigidaire.
