Just Kids
InJust Kids, Patti Smith's first book of prose, the legendary American artist offers a never-before-seen glimpse of her remarkable relationship with photographer Robert Mapplethorpe in the epochal days of New York City and the Chelsea Hotel in the late sixties and seventies. An honest and moving story of youth and friendship, Smith brings the same unique, lyrical quality toJust Kidsas she has to the rest of her formidable body of work--from her influential 1975 albumHorsesto her visual art and poetry.
