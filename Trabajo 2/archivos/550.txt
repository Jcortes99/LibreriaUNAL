Where the Sidewalk Ends
Come in... for where the sidewalk ends, Shel Silverstein's world begins.Shel Silverstein, theNew York Timesbestselling author ofThe Giving Tree,A Light in the Attic,Falling Up, andEvery Thing On It,has created a poetry collection that is outrageously funny and deeply profound.You'll meet a boy who turns into a TV set, and a girl who eats a whale. The Unicorn and the Bloath live there, and so does Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout who will not take the garbage out. It is a place where you wash your shadow and plant diamond gardens, a place where shoes fly, sisters are auctioned off, and crocodiles go to the dentist.Shel Silverstein's masterful collection of poems and drawings stretches the bounds of imagination and will be cherished by readers of all ages.
