Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers
Beloved, best-selling science writer Mary Roach’s classic, now with a new epilogue.For two thousand years, cadavers—some willingly, some unwittingly—have been involved in science’s boldest strides and weirdest undertakings. They’ve tested France’s first guillotines, ridden the NASA Space Shuttle, been crucified in a Parisian laboratory to test the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin, and helped solve the mystery of TWA Flight 800. For every new surgical procedure, from heart transplants to gender confirmation surgery, cadavers have helped make history in their quiet way.Stiffinvestigates the strange lives of our bodies postmortem and answers the question: What should we do after we die?
